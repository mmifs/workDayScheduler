# Work Day Scheduler

This application acts as a scheduler for workday hours 9AM to 5PM. The application will show the current time as the webpage opens below the primary heading of the page. The application allows for a field of text to be saved via local storage for each hour upon clicking on the save icon to the right of each text field, and will remain saved until local storage is cleared.
